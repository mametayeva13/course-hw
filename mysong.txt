It's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start

You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
-----------------------------------------------

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
